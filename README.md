# Stochastically Structured Illumination Microscopy: a scan-less super resolution imaging methodology

Here we publish the code relevant to the pubblication 'Stochastically Structured Illumination Microscopy:
a scan-less super resolution imaging methodology'

The super-resolution algorithm it it written in a matlab file named 'S2IM.m'.
It reads a matlab file 'Input.mat' containing the measurement images 'clean frames' and the movement coordinate 'xshift', 'yshift' and produce an output file 'results.mat'  

To execute the code run 
'
matlab S2IM.m
'
